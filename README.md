📈 Data Source
This dashboard uses flight operation data containing:

Flight schedules and actual times

Delay minutes and reasons

Cancellation and diversion status

Aircraft information

Route details (Origin/Destination)

Geographical data

Note: The dataset used in this project contains synthetic/sample data for demonstration purposes.

🎯 Usage Guide
Select Airlines: Use the sidebar to choose specific airlines for analysis

Set Date Range: Filter data by specific time periods

Explore Visualizations:
